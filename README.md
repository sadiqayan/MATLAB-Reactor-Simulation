# MATLAB Reactor Simulation Project

## Overview

This project involves simulating two types of chemical reactors using MATLAB: the Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) and the Plug Flow Reactor (PFR). The goal is to model and analyze the concentration changes of a reactant as it passes through these reactors. The project includes:

- Simulation of the CSTR and PFR using differential equations.
- Visualization of concentration profiles over time and volume.
- Comparison of reactor performance.

## Project Structure

The project repository contains the following files:

- **`Sadiq Reactor Simulation Tool.m`**: The main MATLAB script that simulates both CSTR and PFR, and plots the results.
- **`Sadiq Reactor Simulation Results.pdf`**: A PDF of the plotted results

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- MATLAB (R2020b or later recommended)

### Running the Simulation

1. **Clone or Download the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ayansadiq/MATLAB-Reactor-Simulation.git
   ```

2. **Open MATLAB:**

   Navigate to the directory where you have saved the project files.

3. **Run the Script:**

   Open the `Sadiq Reactor Simulation Tool.m` file in MATLAB and run it. This script will:

   - Simulate the concentration of a reactant in a CSTR over time.
   - Simulate the concentration of the same reactant in a PFR along the reactor length.
   - Generate plots showing the concentration profiles for both reactors and a comparison plot.

### Understanding the Results

- **CSTR Simulation:**
  The concentration of the reactant is plotted against time. This shows how the concentration changes as it mixes and reacts within the continuously stirred reactor.

- **PFR Simulation:**
  The concentration is plotted against the volume of the reactor. This shows how the concentration changes as the reactant flows through the length of the reactor.

- **Comparison Plot:**
  A combined plot that overlays the CSTR and PFR results for comparison. The volume in the PFR plot is converted to an equivalent time for this comparison.

## Files

- **`Sadiq Reactor Simulation Tool.m`**: MATLAB code to simulate and visualize reactor performance.
- **`Sadiq Reactor Simulation Results.pdf`**: Project results.
